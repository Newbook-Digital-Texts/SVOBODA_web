  At approximately 10:45 I edited all pages to contain a 2017 copyright and upload those edits to the live site.

  At approximately 11:00 I edited all pages to reference the style sheet inside the style folder within the server (ie: href = "style/newbook4.css")

  At approximately 11:08 I edited all pages to remove the "People" dropdown, and renamed the page to be "Staff and Interns"

  At approximately 11:07am I edited the left column navigation bar to remove all drop downs. This was in preparation for the newly updated people page to go online.

  Further, I removed some options from the navigation bar and included them on the homepage.
