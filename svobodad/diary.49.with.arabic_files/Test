   [Notes on the diary transcriptions:
  </p>
  <p>
   In many of the diaries there are marginal notes in Arabic        written in ink by the Baghdad historian Yaqub Serkis sometime        after he received them from Alexander Svoboda probably        in the late 1920s.  Because these notes are a later        addition extrinsic to Joseph Mathia Svoboda's writings,        we have gathered them in an appendix where they are listed        under unique identifiers--for example [A47_006_09:001]--recording        the diary number, place in the diary, and numerical order.        In this edition of the diaries, these identifiers are not        linked directly to the notes in the appendix.
  </p>
  <p>
   For some of the diaries, we have prepared minimal notes and        glosses as well as extensive word lists.        These are available from our website.
  </p>
  <p>
   Images of the original diaries' content are archived        on the University of Washington Libraries        content management system ContentDM.  See:
  </p>

   http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/search/collection/iraqdiaries
  </p>
  <p>
   For many of the diary transcription we have provided        live links to the original diary pages        invoked by clicking on the page numbers in our        HTML display.  Where links are not provided,        one may refer to the original diary images in ContentDM.
  </p>
  <p>
   In several of the diaries, pockets in the back covers        hold a variety of memorabilia including        newspaper clippings, pictures, and souvenirs.  Some        of the textual material has been transcribed and        is visible in the HTML display.  This was not done consistently        but the contents of the pockets are displayed in the images        in ContentDM.]
